Current upcoming TODO list:

DONE 1. Announce when players disconnect or quit from the server (so clients can remove them from the display list)
PARTLY DONE 2. Subclass the player objects as ships and create other subclasses for bullets, mines, torpedos, etc.
DONE 3. Ability for ships to create bullet objects
DONE 4. Bullet type objects need a lifespan.
DONE 5. Server must have a poll cycle and collision detection (ugh). Collision events to clients.
DONE 6. Efficient screen updates (track rectangles, etc.)
6.1 Consider using Pygame sprites for on-screen objects?
DONE 7. Refactor the server/protocol code
DONE 8. Ship fuel levels - report to clients
DONE 9. Shot scoring - report to clients
DONE 10. Asteroids!
PARTLY DONE 11. Custom images/icons in asset directories should communicate to peers (let's avoid sending binaries over network for now)
12. Support for peer-peer messaging (chat)
CUSTOMIZABLE 13. Balance rotational agility, acceleration, shields, weapons. 
DONE 14. Low power retro-thrusting.
DONE 15. Logging off by default, to file upon request.
SKIP 16. Check for and log choke (inability to finish in time slice) [overruns are very common]
17. Predictive behavior on client
DONE 18. More sophisticated lag compensation - round trip timing, command time

Student enhancements:

1. Use assets to enhance appearance and sound.
2. Report scoring information to players
3. Screen zooming, scrolling
4. Aim bots
5. Chat interface

Hmm... not enough here?
